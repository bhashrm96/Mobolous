Q.4 Write an example of joining two models in mongoDB and represent the use of pipeline inside lookup.


A.4 We use the below syntactical code to join two models in mongoDB:-

    {
       $lookup:
         {
           from: <collection to join>,
           localField: <field from the input documents>,
           foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
           as: <output array field>
         }
    }




Part.2  The below code represents the use of pipeline inside lookup:-


    
    
Assuming ywe are trying to lookup all cards documents which contains a specific keyword you want(e.g. "bhavya" in our example"), you may try following code:

db.getCollection(<collection name>).aggregate([
    {
        $lookup: {
            from: "card",
            let: {
                keywordList: "$keywords"
            },
            // this pipeline is used to filter only a list with the keyword
            pipeline : [
                {
                    $project : {
                        keywords : { 
                            $filter: { 
                                input: "$keywords", 
                                as: "keyword", 
                                cond: {
                                    $eq : ["$$keyword.value", "bhavya"]
                                } 
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            ],
            as: "filteredCardLookups"
        }
    },
    {
        $addFields : {
            // this will help to filter out card collection lookup that contains no keyword
            filteredCardLookups : { 
                $filter: { 
                    input: "$filteredCardLookups", 
                    as: "filteredCardLookup", 
                    cond: {
                        $ne : ["$$filteredCardLookup.keywords", []]
                    } 
                }
            }
        }    
    }
]);
